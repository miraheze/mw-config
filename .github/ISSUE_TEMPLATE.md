# PLEASE DO NOT FILE A BUG HERE!

As of April 2016, Miraheze moved from GitHub to [Phabricator](https://phabricator.miraheze.org) for issue tracking. We do not longer fix issues reported on GitHub.

Please use Phabricator from now on to report issues. It won't take long to register at Phabricator, since we offer OAuth integration with our Miraheze wikis and GitHub. Phabricator's markup is almost identical to GitHub's one, so you'll get used to it very fast.
