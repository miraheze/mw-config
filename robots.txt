# robots.txt for Miraheze

# Throttle access to certain pages
# Do not include special pages and other pages where indexing is undesirable if they are likely to be linked to; use noindex instead.
# That's because Google can still index pages in here without crawling them if the pages are linked to
# See https://developers.google.com/search/docs/crawling-indexing/robots/intro
