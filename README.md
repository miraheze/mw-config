# Miraheze's MediaWiki Configuration

![Continuous integration](https://github.com/miraheze/mw-config/workflows/Continuous%20integration/badge.svg)

[Miraheze](https://meta.miraheze.org/wiki/Special:MyLanguage/Miraheze) is a not-for-profit wiki farm that provides free MediaWiki hosting. Miraheze is powered by volunteers only, and we believe our code should be open source.

This repository contains our production MediaWiki configuration. Contributions (see below) are always welcome.

# Contributing

Pull requests are welcome! Please read [our contributing guide](.github/CONTRIBUTING.md) for more information!

# Issues

Our issue tracker can be found on [Phorge](https://issue-tracker.miraheze.org/maniphest/). You may directly open a new issue by clicking [here](https://issue-tracker.miraheze.org/maniphest/task/edit/form/1/). Please read below for security-related concerns.

# Security Vulnerabilities

If you believe you have found a security vulnerability in any part of our code, please do not post it publicly by using our wikis or bug trackers for that; rather, please read our [security page](https://meta.miraheze.org/wiki/Special:MyLanguage/Security) carefully, and follow the instructions.

As a quick overview, you can email security concerns to security@miraheze.org or if you'd like, you can instead directly create a security-related task [here](https://issue-tracker.miraheze.org/maniphest/task/edit/form/2/), but please keep the "Security" project attached to the task.
